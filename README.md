# AHK Scripts
> A collection of useful AHK scripts.

***Most of these scripts are not made by me.***

## My Scripts
- **OpenOrFocus.ahk**: Opens a new chrome tab or focuses it if it exists.
  - **REQUIRES**: [chromix-too](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromix-too)
  - **REQUIRES**: StdOutToVar.ahk
- **SendTextPreserveClipboard.ahk**: Sends text all at once while preserving your clipboard.
  - **WARNING**: Seems to paste your clipboard when sent in quick succession sometimes.
- **NavigateDiscord.ahk**: Navigates to a Discord channel or DM using its quick switcher.
  - **REQUIRES**: SendTextPreserveClipboard.ahk
- **AddDiscordReaction**: Adds a Discord reaction to the latest sent message in the channel.
- **StdOutToVar.ahk**: Runs a console command and returns the output.
- **SelectRandomItemInFolder.ahk**: Selects a random file from a folder and returns its file name.
  - Probably not the most efficient code, takes around 1.5 seconds or less on a folder with 5,700 files (for me).
